# StarTrek
Quick BASIC StarTrek program
Port of the old MBASIC program with some tweaks and bug fixes.

Build/compile the executable QB64 Phoenix Edition.
https://www.qb64phoenix.com/

I used Resource Hacker to embed the icon into the Windows StarTrek.exe.

To create an MSI for windows, use: dotnet build

I have compiled this on Windows and Linux using QB64PE.
